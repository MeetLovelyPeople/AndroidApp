## Overview

This app is used for [Meet Lovely People](http://meetlovelypeople.com) Local website for Dubliners. 

The design of MeetLovelyPeople is responsive that means we can easily create native apps without lot of code by only by using WebView.


## Want to do the Same?

You can also create a dating business for free with for example this **[Free Responsive Dating App Builder](http://ph7cms.com)**. 

You will be able then when your site is live to edit this app and change only `public final static String DOMAIN_SITE = "dublin.meetlovelypeople.com";` by the domain of your site like `public final static String DOMAIN_SITE = "my-ph7cms-dating-app.com";`


Finally, for changing the name of your app, just edit `/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and change the second line like the following: `<string name="app_name">My Awesome Social Dating App</string>`

Then don't forget to compile the project and build the APK file.
